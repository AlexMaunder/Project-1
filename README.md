CodeConqr was built to resolve the need for a interactive programming knowledgebase.

CodeConqr was built utilising a full CRUD system for Languages, Resources, Users and features:
 * Null checks and other edge cases
 * Admin users
 * Dynamic redirects
 * Trix interactive text editor
 * Varied Active Record Associations (HABTM, MTM etc)

# To Do
1. Drag and drop to re-order Languages within a repo:
https://www.kindleman.com.au/blog/drag-and-drop-with-rails-and-html5/ (requires https://github.com/swanandp/acts_as_list to your gemfile to control the db IDs)
OR with JS: https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula | https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/

2. CRUD for Books

3. Dependant destroy (Rails method to delete all dependants when the parent is destroyed â€“ destroy all resources when Repo is destroyed).
